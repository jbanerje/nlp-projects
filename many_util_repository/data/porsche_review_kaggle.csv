2015 Porsche Macan SUV Turbo 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Porsche Macan is a Beast," I owned a Porsche Cayenne for two years and enjoyed it but wanted something with a better balance of power, quickness and supreme handling without giving up sitting up off the road like an SUV offers.  The Macan provides the best driving experience of any car I have ever owned.  The 3.6 L turbo and the standard adaptive suspension make the ride like no other SUV and many 2-door sports cars can’t touch.  The 0-60 in ~4.2 seconds and the ability to masterfully handle curves at higher speeds than you can imagine possible makes every drive an experience.  Beautiful styling in both the interior and exterior.  Porsche has built an amazing high performance vehicle in the Macan Turbo",5
2015 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Outstanding ride!," Love my 2015 Porsche Macan S SUV, but please look hard into buying a maintenance contract. Porsche replacement parts are VERY expensive.",5
2015 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Pretty and comfy," Great looking vehicle with the most comfortable seats.  Could use a little more highway refinement and in my opinion more pickup.  For the cost, I would also like auto braking and better technology",4
2015 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),"Once you've gone Porsche, it's hard to go back"," Crossover that drives like a Porsche- I outgrew my Cayman, but older and wiser doesn't have to mean less fun....",5
2015 Porsche Macan SUV Turbo 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),The 911 SUV," Fun to drive SUV:very close to handling like a 911 in the sport plus mode,A great handling and driving car ;however interior space is small for a SUV;however it has  all the space that I really need .Durability is questionable for a 95000.00 vehicle.At 75000 miles the transmission had to be replaced;even though it was far out of my 50000 mile warranty; Porsche covered the replacement 100%. I also had to replace the valve cover gaskets,at this time. I normally try to drive my Porsche vehicles 150000 to 160000 miles before I sell it or trade it ;however I'm a little nervous about the future dependability of this one;therefore I ordered a 2018 Macon GTS and will off this one at 85000 miles.",5
2015 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Forgot I am driving an SUV," The performance and handling are the obvious reasons for why I got the Macan. But now, after 1300 miles, the experience keeps getting better.  Being 4'11"" is always a challenge but the seat and steering wheel easily accomodate me.  And the side mirror doesn't block my view when making left turns - that is not the case in the Audi Q5 which I also considered. I can see all around which was a problem in the BMW X6 which has a rear window that left me with huge blind spots. The best comfort feature is the vented seats.  In a black with black interior, the vented seats cool quickly and keep me cool on hot summer days. The only nit I have is that the Apple Car Play doesnt always turn on when I plug in my iPhone 6. Although it isnt an issue if my husband plugs in his iPhone 6S. I have one warning, it is easy to go very fast and not realize it. 50 feels like 35. 90 feels like 70.  So newbies need to get used to the handling to control themselves...or not!  Took a ride in my friend's Tesla and while the 400hp could do 0-60 in 4 seconds and make. you feel like you sere on a roller coaster, you felt the curves and the car feels looser. My Macan is much better and hugs the curves for better control.     ----having trouble adding in the purchase date so adding it hear: August 2016 bought a 2017.",5
2015 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Best handling SUV on the market still going strong," It might cost a bit more than the competition but its worth every penny.  My wife thinks it is luxurious and quiet. My kids think its the most comfortable car we owned and my main attraction to the car is its performance and handling.  What kind of black magic is this?!  Porsche tunes their base suspension so well that you will be wasting money on PASM or air suspension.  You won't need it unless you are chasing seconds on a race track.  The S makes plenty power so I wouldn't bother going with the TURBO unless you want to drag race someone all the time.  I would recommend getting at least the BOSE stereo upgrade as the base unit sounds horrible.  I would also recommend getting the sport seat for its superior support and comfort.  If you keep disciplined and not get tempted by all those other options, you can get it at a reasonable price.  I have achieved 29 MPG on the highway at 65 MPH for a 30 minutes stretch.  But it is so much fun getting on the gas and listen to the exhaust pop with the gear change.  The PDK is nothing short of phenomenal.   Your real life mileage will be closer to 20 MPG. Three years in, the car is still a delight. A few recalls have not made any difference to my enjoyment. No unbecoming rattles and shakes. Still have plenty treads on tires and brakes are good for more miles. The Porsche dealers’ pricing for service has gone off the deep end, going from a reasonable $300 for the first service to $1600 for the 30k service. That is basically an oil change and new plugs. Thankfully nothing a local garage cannot handle for a fraction of the cost.  The only dilemma I face is what to replace it with when I sell it.  June 2018 update.  Dealer has learned the errors of its ways.  Whole Service department has be reorganized.  Offering service specials to get its customers back.  Front tires still have 4/32 and rears 6/32.  Will replace after the summer.  Everything still working well.  Still don't see anything in the market which could be a worthwhile replacement.",5
2015 Porsche Macan SUV Turbo 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Pocket rocket," Too fast, too sophisticated, reliable and one hell of a German masterpiece.",5
2015 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Sport Sedan in an SUV Body," I had mixed feelings about buying this car because I had a Lexus RX400h with 105,000 miles on it that was still a perfectly good car. I didn't need a new car, however I was so tired of driving the Lexus. And the difference in driving pleasure of the Porsche vs. Lexus is night and day. The Porsche is an SUV that is actually fun to drive. Great handling and acceleration. And while the Lexus was comfortable, the Porsche feels much more special with higher quality fit and finish. I'm partial to Porsche's based on currently owning a Boxster S and having 911's in the past. The Macan is very bit a Porsche. I also test drove the new Volvo XC90 and BMW X5 before deciding on the Macan S. Both have interiors just as nice as the Macan, and in fact I liked the Volvo interior the best. However neither came close to the driving performance and feel of the Macan S.",5
2015 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),I love this CAR!!!," Compared to any other car I have ever owned, this tops the cake!  Drives like a car, yet sits higher and has a bit more carrying capacity than a car.  I no longer get upset about sitting in traffic, even though this car wants to race!!",5
2015 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Best of Both Worlds: Sports Car and Space," After owning a Mercedes Benz ML 500 for 6 years, I decided it was time to change. Since we were sort of out of the woods (no more strollers and other junk that the parent of a baby or toddler has to carry around), we were willing to downsize a little bit. We test drove the new ML which was more of the same with a few more bells and whistles and knew that we wanted something different. Something unique. Test drove the Maserati Ghibli and it was very nice but we did not consider buying it; it would have to have been a lease. Considered buying a Porsche Panamera. Test drove the Panamera and I loved the PDK (Porsche Dupple Kupplung; double clutch) transmission. Very smooth, quick, and responsive gear changes. But the Panamera felt like a boat and the standard 6 cylinder did not have enough juice. I read about Macan and began to really research it and decided to take one for a test drive at work and I was sold on the spot. I had just bought a 911 at that time and the Macan felt like a 4 door 911. Took the wife to the dealership for a test drive and she loved it as well. I also test drove the Cayenne. The Cayenne felt more like the ML - felt heavy and wasn't peppy. We ordered the Macan around Holloween and got it March of this year.After 6 months of ownership I cannot find a single flaw with the car. It is amazing in every way. It is very responsive and agile. It handles really well. The PDK transmission is very smooth and shifts great and has real paddle shifters instead of those terrible buttons. Switch it into sport mode and the transmission shifts are even quicker and the entire responsiveness of the car is even better. I truely feel like this car is a 4 door 911. There is also plenty of space for luggage for those trips to the beach and/or for going out of town. I've heard some complaints about the rear seat knee room, but everything has a price in my opinion and there has to be a compromise somewhere between sportiness and space which in concept are opposing principles.",5
2015 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Safety First - He ran a red light!," My wife and I along with some friends thought we go see some interesting art yesterdat.  Less than a mile from the house, we were hit on the driver side by a PU that was going about 45-50mph.  He never touched his brakes from what I can tell.  My view was block by another vehicle but I did see catch him out of the side of my eye right before impact and was able to swerve a little.  Both side impact bags deployed and surprisingly, no glass was broken.  It spun us in a complete 360.  The vehicle did what it was design to do and there was no intrusion into the passenger cabin however the truck did do a number on the left rear tire and wheel. The only injury was to the occupant in the rear passenger seat suffering 6 fractured ribs from the seat belt, but I'll take that any day.  I haven't inspected the vehicle but I'll bet that it's totaled.  This accident happened so fast that none of the passengers were able to brace.  I  am very pleased with how it did with this impact to the driver's side passenger door albeit not a Tbone.  I understand from the Euro safety test that the Macan got good grades and that was proved up this Sept 5th.  If anyone wants pictures, I have some.",5
2015 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),"love, love it!!!!", I bought my Macan S a week ago and I love it. It rides so smooth and quiet. My gas mileage is 19 mpg but I haven't been driving with gas mileage in mind. I love everything about it. I look for reasons to go places just to drive it around. My review may be premature but so far its great. ,5
2015 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Best Luxury SUV," Great mileage, over 25 mpg, great handling, ride, and acceleration. Cost is inline with competition, but resale is sky high. One weakness is interior storage space for a purse, etc. We test all cars and this is the one we bought. That says in all. Buy it and enjoy.",5
2015 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),My 22nd new vehicle," My Macan S is by far the most enjoyable new car in my long car-buying history. I have purchased Ford, Olds, Nissan, Toyotas, Honda, Acuras, Infiniti, BMWs, but not since my '98 E36 M3 have I been so thoroughly impressed with a car. Great handling PLUS great ride, solid, quiet (almost too quiet), fast, plus much better mpg than I expected (23.8 @ 2600 miles)...I make up excuses to go places just to drive this car. Didn't rate reliability because it's new & my 1st Porsche. Came from '08 and '10 MDX, & was going to try X-3 35i until the Macan info came out in January. Picked mine up in May.8/16 Update:Still love this car at 2+ years and 27K miles. 100% trouble-free (only few software updates). Got over 25mpg on recent road trip. Still solid and rattle-free. Only ""negatives"" would be reg maintenance cost (i.g. oil changes) overpriced. And the sun visors could be a little larger.Update:At 40 months, still my favorite new purchase. Had 2 recalls handled with a morning visit, but zero problems to date. Still drives like new. Great exhaust sound.  Usually get ""new car bug"" at 3 years. Recent test drives of new competition leave me unimpressed (except for new Panamera 4S which is out of my $ range). I check trade-in value every year (avg. of KBB, Black book, Edmunds, NADA), and residuals are extremely high. $about $14.5K depreciation for 36 mos, 35K miles. Outstanding.",5
2015 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),The car has 22500 miles and is great., The car has had no mechanical problems over the past 2 years. It is fun to drive both short and long trips.  My wife likes it better than her car. I will not buy anything other than Porsche from now on.,5
2018 Porsche Macan SUV Sport Edition 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM),Great SUV but it’s not perfect," The good:Great performance, good handling and very comfortable. The 18 way adjustable seats are excellent. Interior leather overall is high quality. Heated and cooled seats work great. Very low road noise and excellent sound system (I have the premium audio option). The interactive cruise control is a great option. Of course it looks great!The bad: The infotainment interface is poor. Just getting it registered with Porsche is a major headache. The navigation system data entry is useless. It seems the database is not fully updated. Difficult to find addresses and forget searching by point of interest. My 2011 BMW X5 was much better. No real time traffic information even thought it’s supposed to have this feature.The control switches for the info system are more VW than Porsche. Does not feel like it’s high quality.Air con is working OK but does not seem as powerful (cool down) as other cars I have owned. Just about good enough.The ugly: The layout of the switches and in the centre consul is confusing. Forget the buttons in the overhead consul while driving. Just can’t see them. The garage opener is hard to program. I managed to get it working but the instructions are poor. The dealer also tried but it did not work first time.The external temperature sensor is never accurate. Porsche say it’s something to do with the sensor location and you need to drive at least three miles for it to read properly. Never had a car like that!The parking system is very limited. Just a rear camera and audible sensors front and rear. No 360 degree camera. Last but not least the service cost. First service is just an oil change $800!. 2nd service (20,000) is an oil change and some filters $1,200. In three years normal service >$2,400. Since the motor is same as Audi and VW this is just over charging. I got my services included free of charge in the lease.Apple car play is included in the connect services. So to keep it after the first year it will cost $400 per year. Unfortunately more Porsche greed. Do I like the car. No. I love it. Best SUV from a drivers view point and it looks fantastic.",4
2018 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Just crossed 40k miles," Purchased this vehicle 10/15 and have primarily used it for Hwy driving and touring with a couple of golden retrievers. The Macan is a sports car with a hatch, its not really a family car but can easily handle a girlfriend (if she's low maintenance) and a couple of 70lb pups.  The interior is top notch, the base hi-fi is just fine, bluetooth and music (IPOD) connectivity are flawless. Seats (Porsche can rip you off here) need to be the middle package (Premium package) and stick with 19 tires... the 20's may look cool but wear faster and frankly just add to the cost IMO. I chose the sunroof and rails too... The ride: The car handles like a well behaved sports car (I also have a 997 C2S and 996 GT3) and can get you in trouble when going from 70 to 100 in a flash... its effortless.  I also have an X5 and two X3's in the stable (kids and dog/beach mobile)... they're great trucks... the Macan ain't that.  I'll buy again when this hits 150k and I give it to my daughter...",5
2018 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),All around great vehicle," Owned the Macan for 6 months and just finished a 2500 mile West Coast road trip.  Winding 2 lane roads thru the redwoods were as much fun as long, flat, ‘see for 50 miles in all directions’, desert roads. The vehicle is a blast to drive. Average speed was 70 MPH. The biggest problem was keeping the speed below 110 while passing 18 wheelers - it quickly accumulates speed. Fuel mileage averaged 22 MPG for the trip. The Macan replaced a Cayenne S with 120,000 miles. While the Macan has a much smaller storage capacity, it is 100% more fun to drive. The fit and finish of the vehicle is of the highest quality.",5
2018 Porsche Macan SUV 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM),Just switched, Traded in 328i x drive.  Nothing handles like a Porshe.  Went on a road trip and did not want it to end. Every aspect is great especially going around turns.,5
2018 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),My Macan S is better than I anticipated, Work closely with your dealer as everything you must add is an option!,5
2018 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Mecan S," Know that this car is overall quite good. We purchased the car in Florida where roads are fairly smooth and there the car rode smoothly. In May we returned to Wisconsin where roads are very rough. Our car has 20"" Spider wheels with Pirelli tires. The ride of the car in Wisconsin is very rough and quite noisy, as the road imperfections are transferred sharply through the suspension. Not very forgiving and very sport car like. Our second car is a BMW X3, 2018 as well. Day to night difference in the ride and smoothness on the road. Not totally dissatisfied with the Mecan S  however I prefer to drive the Bimmer 10 out of 10 times.",3
2018 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),You get what you pay for," OK, other SUVs get slightly better gas mileage and a bit more cargo space. But, no SUV can touch the Macan S in drivability. It's very fast. Never any lean or lag. Great smooth ride, not bouncy. The steering is just right in effort and road hold and feedback. Braking is strong. Love the dry sump oil pumps that make the car quieter and accelerate better. Two turbos for extra torque and agility. I tested all the luxury SUVs and the Macan S immediately stood out. I was blown away when I drove it.",5
2018 Porsche Macan SUV 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM),Macan drives like the Cayman with more room," This car is very quiet, has excellent acceleration and handles like the Cayman (which I also own). This car replaced a 2017 Mercedes GL250 which I regret purchasing. Front seat comfort is exceptionally comfortable even for my 6’7” neighbor that went for a test drive (however, you wouldn’t want to be sitting in the rear seat behind him).",5
2018 Porsche Macan SUV 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM),Santa barbara to newport," Love this car. I have owned BMW's for 35 years, most recently a 640. I decided on the Macan and was going to get the S, but chose to load up with seats, executive package, stereo, 20"" Sypder wheels, etc. The power difference between the Macan and the S, to me, was negligible. Think I'm a confirmed Porsche man....",5
2018 Porsche Macan SUV GTS 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),2018 Macan GTS is the BEST," Bought it sight unseen and no test drive. Of course, this is my fifth Porsche in 20 some years. The Macan GTS is unbelievable. Great handling, great mileage, drop it into sport plus mode and blow the doors off almost anything on the road.",5
2018 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Proud Porsche Purchaser, Great car. Great looks and handling.,5
2017 Porsche Macan SUV 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM),Over the Top," This vehicle does everything well.  As marked above, I consider it to be a best in class in all categories.",5
2017 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),this is the one to get," Over the last 15 years I've had an X5 and two X3's, all brilliant SUVs in their own right, but this one is in a class all by itself. The drive and handling are typical Porsche; the more and the harder you drive it, the more confidence it instills. It's simply unflappable. It doesn't handling quite at the level of a 911 or a Boxster, but no other SUV even comes close, the aforementioned bimmers included. It even gets better mileage than either the X5 or the X3's. The Macan's styling is superb, and although it is built on the same platform as the Audi Q5, compared side-by-side it makes the Q5 look like a soap box. Admittedly the Macan S runs a few grands higher than all the other mentioned vehicles, but don't let that deter you from a test drive. It might just change your mind. It did mine.",5
2017 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Bought it for Performance," Have a 2016 Macan S with over 40,000 miles.  Not one problem so far.  Service can be expensive but most service instructions are on the internet : ie, how to change air filters and plugs.  Local dealer is excellent.   Competition may provide more electronics and other things, but i purchased a Porsche simply for performance and i have not been disappointed.",5
2017 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),I love my Macan," I love my Macan..it’s comfortable for long rides and it’s so nimble, that is a pleasure to drive...I’m so happy with it..can’t imagine downgrading to another car after this...my last car was a 2016 Volvo XC60 and I liked that car too...but the Macan is in a different class...",5
2017 Porsche Macan SUV 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM),Not safe to own. Curtain airbags did not deploy.," We were T-boned in an intersection spinning our car sideways towards where the other car is coming from. The curtain airbags did not deploy. The passenger door where my 10 year old daughter was sitting twisted that both doors on the right side cannot be opened.Porsche claimed that it has to be at a certain speed and angle for it to deploy. Seriously? It would have been a different story if we were injured. Luckily, we were ok. What is sad is porsche stated that there is no need for further investigation since the technician claimed that it did not meet the threshold. Well how do I know if the sensors are working ok if they dont test it? If you care for safety, I don’t recommend porsche cars. I believe its better and safer to drive asian luxury cars for the price you pay.",2
2017 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Drivers car, Performance and handling are exceptional. PDK transmission is outstanding. Best handeling suv I have driven.,5

2017 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Bad lease disappointing experience with Macan.," 3 years of lease with this Macan. Hopefully this is ending in february od 2018 and we can rid of it ! Lot of problems , too often in the car dealer . We had problems with steering wheel and transmition once, have several issues with brakes noises,  problems with stero/radio not working properly.... That it was not expecting when choosing a Porsche.   Even though when big issues happened we didnt have any support from Atlanta headquarters and Miami dealer.  A deep disapointment overall.  Two friends of mine (company' peers) have had Macan and they are cancelling lease too, so I guess it is not a good bet . You are warned by three diferent clients!.",2
2017 Porsche Macan SUV GTS 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Its a Beautiful Car," I really wanted this Porsche and we traded my BMW X5 for it and my hubby's 911, however, now I don't want to take it many places because it was so darned expensive that I just want it to sit in the garage! lol  I miss the shoulder and open room of my X5 and some other little features that you don't realize you enjoyed until they were gone. Soft close doors, heads up display, just the roomy feel in general.  I love, love, love the Macan, however, being in my 50's now and not in my 20's, I enjoy the ease of getting in a vehicle as well as getting out, and that is very tight in this beauty.  However, once you're in, it fits like a glove and rides like a dream.  I'm torn with keeping her or getting the new Audi SQ5 or the Volvo XC-60 R Design.  I'm truly a car person and giving up that Porsche for one of those is definitely going to feel like going a few steps down.  I'm torn I tell you!!",4
2017 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),yolo, shop around because you will find $3500 differences. And test drive a few times also tube the reviews,5
2017 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),retired ole goat !," Reaching our late 60's, my wife and I have had Blazers, Tahoe, BMW X-5, Mercedes ML series.  We needed a somewhat smaller SUV but still haul grandkids, dogs, groceries, hardware around.   The Macan S had all the accessories that we needed and wanted.  The vision 360 degrees is great.  Comfort is fantastic.  Performance is perfect, this ole goat can run with any of them!  The Macan is easy to maneuver and park.  I took a close friend for a ride and he was astounded at the interior design and room! If you are considering updating an SUV and don't take a look at the Macan, you are cheating yourself.",5
2017 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Love and hate this car...," What I love about this Macan: Comfort, popular, good looks, quiet, fun to drive, good build quality. What I hate about this Macan: Maintenance is really expensive. In 40K miles I have spent $2250 versus Audi Q5 $1100 which I owned before. Audi's brakes need replacement every 25K. The dealer also was very stubborn on taking anything off the MSRP. Would I repeat this purchase? Probably not, you can save a few bucks buying the maintenance contract ahead which they didn't even offer me.",4
2017 Porsche Macan SUV 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM),2 months in and still love it!!," I came out of a newer BMW convertible.  Loved that car but needed something with just a bit more practicality.  I looked at these on a whim and fell in love with the styling both inside and out.  As soon as my wife sat in it she said....I want this car.   Opted for the base with the premium plus package and 20"" wheels plus a couple other options.  Bought it for $52k net.   I feel that it's actually a great value for what you get and there isn't another compact crossover that can touch it in the driving dynamics department.  Handles like a 911.  Average mid 20s on the highway on premium fuel.  No complaints so far.  The back seat could be a bit bigger,  but it suits my 12 year old just fine.",5
2017 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Nothing spectacular," I should start off by saying I am a Cayenne owner who got the chance to drive the Macan S as a loaner car for 4 days. I was generally quite disappointed. I've driven many kinds of cars, and the Macan simply does not stand out. I'm surprised by the overwhelmingly positive reviews, as the car does not live up to it. It is a rather average ride dressed up with a somewhat fancy interior that isn't particularly spacious or functional. Porsche has a way of making cars that are large on the outside and small on the inside (this complaint applies to the Cayenne as well). The rows of buttons in the center console is getting old, and the entertainment console is a joke compared to what you'd find in a Tesla. The exhaust note is a gimmick aimed at impressing new-to-Porsche owners, as the car is not particularly fast. A small capacity engine aided by turbo charger just doesn't cut it. After you spend some time with the car, you really start to feel like ""Hey, this drives like any other car!"". After my short stint with the Macan, I couldn't be happier to return the loaner.",3
2017 Porsche Macan SUV GTS 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Pretty darn fast," I have owned BMWs for over 40 years. This Macan GTS is my first Porsche and it is great. It needs two things 1) to be available in a manual transmission (I know I can't shift as well as this transimission but It's more fun) and 2) to have a day time backlit tach when the lights are off (even paddle shifting needs a visible tach). I offered to buy a second Macan for my wife, but she won't give up her Mini because she loves a manual transimission too. I still have my BMW stick, as well. Our left feet are so bored with no clutch to operate. Having said all that, the Macan is still kick to drive. Love the way it sounds in Sport and Sport + mode.",5
2017 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),First Porsche Macan S- IN LOVE!," This is my first SUV; previous owner of Audi A5 and a few BMW 3-series cars.  Wanted something sporty but higher off the ground.  Really happy thus far with purchase.  In addition, I purchased tire warranty and 5-year maintenance warranty.  It is peace of mind for me.  Interesting enough, I saw a nail in my tire just today so the warranty will come in handy inside of my first month of ownership.",5

2017 Porsche Macan SUV Turbo 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Porsche misses big," This car is full of mechanical problems.  To include leaking fuel line, and exhaust brackets that easily brake causing horrendous noise.  Well below even average quality.  The roadside (yes you will need it!!) service is poor.  The ""concierge"" service is a joke.  They will tell you where you can go rent a car and they might pay for it after your $90,000 crappy car breaks down for the second time in 20k miles.  Porsche has become a watered down brand with poor quality and even worse service! AVOID!!",2
2017 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Great driver but poor technology," Moved up from Audi S6 to Macan S.   Great driver very good acceleration, handling and braking.   However it's at least 5 years behind Audi for technology.   Actually discovered after picking up the vehicle - has no voice control.  Apple car play requires phone to be ard wired to special plug. Very little control over car features.   If you want a great driving SUV this is top of the list - but be warned a Chevy Cruze actually is more technical advanced for connectivity.",3
2017 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),"17,000 miles in a year and I have three other cars"," I have a 997.1, a Box S and a high mileage BMW X5. I bought this vehicle as a present for myself after finishing my last Chemo treatment...  I've owned Porsche's for over forty years, numerous types including, 911's, 996's, 997's, boxster s, Cayenne and even a 914 in my younger days. The Macan is by far the best balanced SUV-sports car for the money you can find. Mine is not highly optioned. The engine is responsive in all ranges, the braking smooth and intuitive and the handling sublime;  that's without any of the pricey suspension options. The base stereo is just fine and I consider myself an audiophile, the added sunroof and lane change assist were my add's along with the premium package.... $59.6k. The Macan has been a pleasure on long drives down the Big Sur coast or through the high Sierras... and the base seats are a lot more comfortable than my 997.  The one thing you have to be careful about is the quickness of this car to go from 70 to 95 in a heart beat... its that fast.",5

2017 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),"wow! update ""double wow"" 2017 Macan S"," after driving bmw's for the last 25 years, decided to try a Macan S. What a great decision I made....smile.......... Powerful and my Macan S 2017 is a sports car acting machine outdoing most of the bmw's I have owned..........with the possible exception of my 3 series M convertible. It is a truly great combination of practicality and driving excitement. This is a Porsche, no doubt about it, from the sound of the engine to going around 35mph corners at 60...........its a Porsche! The ride and noise in the cabin are muted and comfortable, bumps are a little harsh, but the other attributes of the vehicle are well worth the small aggravation of the semi stiff ride. After all this is not a Lexus RX. Cabin is done very well with great materials and is big enough for me, 6'3"", 260lbs. I am not sure what I would do to improve this vehicle, not anything I can come up with right now. 5 stars for sure...........................yippee!!!! UPDATE: 6mo owning the vehicle, 7000 miles. double down on all statements previous. nothing about the vehicle that I can complain about. it is really a blast to drive, so much in fact I find myself taking the long way to almost everywhere I go and going for joyrides very often. I have not had my first ticket yet as I am a careful driver, but the car is so responsive it is hard to drive the speed limits. Whatever speed you are going seems to slow. Get one or test drive one, until you do, you can not possibly know what I know. It is driving heaven. UPDATE, one year later.......... all review items remain at same high levels. I find myself driving places I don't need to go just to be driving. This is truly a great vehicle and it seems priced correctly for the quality and image that you get driving a Porsche. I am very pleased with this vehicle and it will be hard to drive anything else after this experience. update: 18 months owned, 18k miles. no further comments, all of my previous comments stand as written. Great Vehicle. Update, 23k miles. No change, 5+ stars! Yippee!!",5

2016 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Just over 32k miles... in twenty months.," This is the long term review. From day one this car has been a pleasure to drive, my 997 spends most of its time resting in the garage. Also in the stable (kids & dog car) are a BMW X5 and two BMW X3's. The Porsche is a sports car with a hatch that you can drive comfortably for eight hours without fatigue... the BMW's are older, well made and are not as fast or handle as well. The M series may be different. The Porsche excels with handling speed and comfort. The car has been in for service due to brake booster issues (vacuum leak) at 30k miles and routine maintenance. Tire wear has been surprisingly little... I owned a Cayenne that ate tires, so having great Michelin tires that look and drive new with 32k miles on them is a bonus. I fully expect to drive this car well over the 100k mark just like the BMW's... oil changes every 7500 and enjoy a wet golden retriever and a surfboard in the back...",5
2016 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),One of the best SUV's on the market," This is one of the best SUV's you can buy at the 52-55K price point. Performance wise, it feels like you driving an larger sports car. Acceleration is on point, and handling is very tight for a car this size. When you hit the brakes you feel it.  Aesthetically the outside of the car is beautiful, with curves and design that make it look very elegant and sporty. It looks like a traditional Porsche. Personally I'm not a fan of the interior, the cockpit layout of the buttons is too much for me and makes it feel like your in a 747. Also not a fan of the navigation system, but if Porsche is able to incorporate the new nav systems they have for the 718 for newer editions then that problem is solved.  Overall great car, would take this over a BMW X4 any day.",5

The Macan S sport SUV compact come very close to giving me a similar driving experience, especially driving in the sport mode, however it's not a Carrera. I am enjoying the overall performance, acceleration, braking and road handling from my Macan S. The transmission (PDK) is outstanding and its make the Macan fun to drive.",5

2016 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Practical Porsche," Owning a Porsche generally means giving up on some degree of practicality in terms of having a car that is a ""daily driver"". The Macan lets those of us with kids still in car seats have the opportunity to enjoy Porsche's legendary performance in a vehicle that is at home at the mall as it is on the track. The highest levels of performance come on the GTS model, but the ""S"" model offers plenty of acceleration and more capability than most drivers will ever exploit. The 18 way power seats are phenomenal and a worthwhile upgrade. The ""premium plus"" option includes keyless entry and ignition as well an upgraded sound system and ventilated/ heated seats. The 2017 model year has an upgraded touch screen navigation that is better than previous models, but not nearly as user friendly as some of the competitions. The packages will easily turn this $54,000 car into $70-90,000 car, but nobody walks into this purchase expecting a great value.",5

I trimmed it out to my liking so suffice it to say it's a bad azz all around vehicle. The power is plenty, the handling is insane and I love the look of this car....Agate gray with black wheels. When I have a choice to take a car out it is now always the Macan.....always. The Jeep is 4 years old now and guess what I did? I ordered a Macan Turbo for me. 120 more days and I'll have no more envy issues. I looked at the GLE 63S and other bigger Performance SUV's but afer a year of looking I was afraid whatever I Bought wouldn't equal the Macan. Why fight it?If I hear one more time the Macan is the baby brother to the Cayenne I'm gonna lose it. The Cayenne to the Macan is like a Cessna to a Gulfstream. Please.",5

I loved driving it so much that I bribed her to take my 2014 BMW 535iX mSport and a promise that she can pick a luxury sedan when the BMW's lease comes up in 5 months. The Macan S is now my daily driver into Manhattan and it's a pleasure to drive. It's pretty comfortable, extremely tight and fun to drive. I got the White Ash interior package which is very unique and extremely high-end looking. Just feels like a million bucks when driving. The only knock on it is the base stereo is not very good (I overlooked it because I liked the White Ash interior so much and didn't want to wait 3 months). The S is plenty of power with 340 hp.

Ideal for those who do not like/need sedans or low profile sports cars, but are not ready to settle for a huge SUV. That's when Macan comes in place! Compact SUV is exactly what it is, but add here 340 hp (for base model Macan S), smooth ride, amazing maneuverability, interior comfort and at least two packages - and you will enjoy it without paying $100,000.

Same great 7-speed PDK transmission as the boxster with smooth shifting that is difficult to feel. Mileage is about 21 mpg overall so far, so the factory mileage obviously depends on the driver and the conditions. This is mostly suburban driving but I believe the smooth engine turn-off and turn-on when you stop/go is part of the solid mileage for this 4100 lb, 340 HP car. My wife's car and she loves the ride and ease of driving and the handling. It just goes where and when you want total smoothness. The standard ride package is excellent so we did not get the sport package. Love the backup camera and the map display. Love it just as much after almost 3 years.

Pros: Luxurious, sound of the exhaust pipes, performance, good options which cover most of the use-cases & requirements, leather seats, panoramic roof, PDLS(this is a worth feature)Cons: the infotainment system looks pretty old though when compared to Audi/BMW.

I want a drivers performance sport car that drives like a formula 1 car.   I did not want a computer, phone, gizmo terminal that  is to defeat the reason to have a porsche .        Running Michelin PS Z  tires and the car is stable and smooth all the way to 150....   I can take 55 mph curves at 100 with ease.   When manual shifting I wind it to 4800 rpm and shift... and you feel like your on a rocket...  in 400 yards your doing 80.... from a standing start.     Gas milage, about 19.8-20.5 at speeds of 75-85      Ac is good.      What I do like is the simple dash with out the screens and entertainment.  Everything easy to run.  Gages easy to read,   I have a MBZ 250 coupe and the porsche is in the same quality range   Dealer service is fantastic and I get new Porsche loaner cars wa every service.   With 80,000 miles any worry about engine problems is far from a problem.  Sold the car last month, because I came to the realization that I was overwhelmed by the high performance and speed the Caymen would do...   Speed?    In a short deserted desert road I put it to the floor....got to 155 before I backed off...it was still climbing.    This is a car for the person that is on top of his driving game and skill.   The car demands 200% attention like flying an airplane,if you don't have that skill level it can kill you.... This is not a daily commute driver.  Its hard core performance stuff.  You can keep up with Lamborghini and Ferrari's if that is your wish ( top speed Porsche lists is 212 mph)After owing the car for a year, I came to the realization that if I kept the car it would very likely kill me.    Its a safe car as I mentioned it is like a safe airplane  in that it requires a person trained in its operation.  You can not just go turn the key and zip off because your going to be unaware of the dangers of operation such a high performance machine  and worse the temptation to exceed your ability skill level very, very fast    I sold the car recognizing  that it is like a motorcycle in that its not IF it is going to hurt you but WHEN.  I also discovered that My MBZ 250C, with the same tires, handled just about as well and a lot more comfortably and quietly.

2008 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),watch out for pricing," A good handling car but its easy to overpay. Dealers overcharge on the car and once you buy the car and want to sell it you notice you really overpaid. IMS problems plague this model, could be running then the IMS bearing explodes and you have a major engine catastrophe. Not like a American car or Japanese car the price would be outrageous a new engine and then you have to junk the car. I suggest getting a 2009 or later version. These cars don’t sell well new and are scarce, overpaying is easy.

And I've driven cars of all types, sizes, shapes, and costs.People regularly give it some great looks when I'm driving around town and rarely does a highway trip happen that someone doesn't pull up next to me with a ""thumbs up"".Sounds great, handles great, and has more storage room than you'd think given it's size.",5

Acceleration could be better for the price, but I was never planning to do any drag-racing anyway.  The big problem is the abominable base stereo, which came with the car as ordered by the dealer (it was a leftover 2008 that I got a very good price).  This stereo was state of the art in 1970, and I figured I could upgrade it with aftermarket equipment, but at $2200 just for new speakers and amps, I decided to just live with it.  If you get a Cayman, be sure to order the Bose upgrade.",5

The next day my wife and I left on a trip to a wedding and vacation in NYC.  We were able to pack for week long trip with formal clothes for rehearsal dinner and formal wedding.  All our luggage fit no problem.  I then got sick and my wife had to drive to NYC she had not driven a manual in 10 yrs and wanted to practice before leaving the hotel.  She shifted twice said this is great and before I knew it we were comfortably cruising at 80 mph.  My car in 9 months has been trouble free and a blast to drive.

I now look forward to driving to and from work and on date nights with my wife. The performance is great and I many times take the long way home to spend a little more time in it. I recommend the Bose stereo upgrade for more low end punch, but many times I find myself listening to the engine sounds more than the radio/cd. Be careful with your customization as it can be expensive. Choose wisely. I am very happy with the standard leather interior and dash. A little more durable than having the full leather interior. The ride is firm, but this is a sports car after all.",5

This is one of those.  With the sharp snarl of lighting up the 6-cylinders that share the mid-chassis location giving perfect balance, you know this is a drivers' car.  Spartan but comfortable, the interior is well laid out and gadget free. Lots of leg and head room, and excellent views without blind spots.  Until you've driven a Porsche, you'll not appreciate the torque that makes the 6-speed transmission more than enough to zing to 60 mph in under 5 seconds, and brakes to stop as quick.",5

The engine puts out unmistakable note that sounds almost like a symphony orchestra. The car averages 19.7 mpg and I couldn't be more happy given it acceleration & performance. Some complaints I have about this car are body integrity, stereo and Tiptronic buttons. Its rear-end produces rattle noises.

It doesn't take long to see the car is quality built and all the details were done extremely well. One thing is I am tall and fit into the Cayman with absolutely no problem. The headroom is great. It shifts beautifully and there is no other word except ""fun"" to describe driving this car. My two sons who are in their 20s say ""dad you finally got a cool car"" which just shows the younger generation knows something good when they see it. Would highly recommend this car to anyone considering it. ",5
2008 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),The Perfect Car," The Porsche Cayman is by far the most well engineered car I have driven. I have test driven most of its competitors and the handling, responsiveness, as well as the overall quality is superb without reservation.  The mileage for a sports car is excellent and surprised me. The comfort is excellent, especially in the lower back area. I have been envying Porsches ever since I was in high-school. As another Porsche owner told me, this is a sports car not a luxury car masquerading as a sports car. After I drove it I could clearly see what she meant.   The swaying factor around curves is for the most part non-existent.  The bottom line is this car is the best choice in its class.",5

I own #350 of 777 and everywhere I go it is a sure stunner. I always grew up loving the 911 but I must say this car has done it for me, and although it may not put up 911 numbers it is the most practical for an everyday car weekend driving enthusiast. The exhaust is so sweet and the comfort of the interior is awesome. I am 5/9"" and have driven passenger as tall as 6'3"" and they all are in awe at that space and the drive.  This car is a keeper and I can only see it appreciating in value. ",5
2008 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Perfectly balanced," The blend of handling, braking and acceleration makes the car a joy to drive.  I purchased a basic model (non-s, 5 speed, 19 inch wheels, bose, heated seats) which was actually hard to find.  If you want to pay for all the other goodies go for it, but they are expensive and some add quite a bit of weight. Trust me, you won't miss them and you can save 25 grand.  It's a driver's car all the way but remarkably comfortable, quiet, and it really does get the 29 mpg highway. ",5
2008 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),2008 Cayman," This is the latest of many Porsches I have owned. My first 911 was purchased in 1972 and the last was a 1997 993 C4S.

2015 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 6M),2017 Cayman 2.7L / 6 Speed," I purchased this car four months ago as my daily driver, and just turned 6,000 miles yesterday.  Absolutely love it.... the six speed gearbox is the best I have ever driven (other manual transmission cars I've owned include BMW M5, Toyota Supra Turbo, Saab Viggen, Corvette, Pontiac Trans-Am and Saab 9000 Aero) .  Everything about this car keeps a smile on my face... handling, performance, exhaust note, comfort.  Even in traffic it is a delight to drive.  Word of warning that a Cayman can get expensive with the 'a la carte' approach to options... I kept mine pretty simple.  Key options I think are a must are 20"" wheels, Sport Chrono Package, Bose stereo, and get the 'clear bra' to protect the nose from stones which will damage the paint.  With those, you will not be disappointed.  The only trick which takes a few days to master is getting in if you are a big guy (I'm 6'3"" 220 lbs) but once I did, simple!  One surprise is that Porsche does not offer any extended warranty in the US.  Will have to see if that is an issue once factory warranty is up.  Expect $300 / oil change.",5
2015 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 6M),Totally engaging," I've driven it for 1500miles and still look forward to every drive. I've owned other sports cars, yet none has come close to given me such driving bliss. My car has the PDK, and the 18"" wheels, both are concessions to  stop and go traffic and poorly maintained roads, yet it's still fantastically engaging. I recommend PASM, it improves ride on poor surfaces, yet on better roads improves handling. Although, I have the sport chrono package, I'm not sure it's worth it. I highly recommend upgrading to the Xenon lights. The heated seats are awesome and surprisingly in the winter you'll love the heated steering wheel. The Bose system is a must have if you like music. The build quality was perfect.",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Cheap Fun, Bought it 2016 with 94K miles. Sold it 2017 with 118K miles only because I lost my job. Great car for the money. Upgrade to low temp waterpump. Spent maybe 2K in maintenance but that’s not much for a Porsche. ,5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Loads of fun!, Upgrade the stereo system. Everything else is great!,5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Continues to delight!," Very enjoyable car, nice ride, great sound and decent power from the 2.7 six. Engine very flexible and very smooth.  AC keeps up with high summer temps.  New cost is moderately high but used/certified cost is a lot of car for the money. Design is wonderful and stays in style for a long time. Wonderful sound and driving experience.",4
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Great car," We have had this car for about a month.It is much faster than our '06 Boxster.The engine sounds great.We have an automatic, which makes it a bit of a gas hog, but it shifts quickly and rockets away from the line.",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Better than I  expected," Have been interested in this car for a while. Finally had the chance to drive one and fell in love. Plenty of room with the seat all the way back, great driving position, perfect balance and the sweet sound of the engine. I don't think it gets much better than this. Plan on having this for a long time.",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Best car I have driven, I previously had an SLK and a Z4 convertible.  This 2 dr Cayman is so much more fun to drive. I feel like a million dollars whenever I get in it and have owned it for a year and I am not bored with it yet.  I bought it used with low miles and would only trade it in if I was buying another Porsche.,5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Great Car," Great car! Have owned it for just over a year and love driving it both to work and on weekend fun trips. Do not plan to drive it cross country, but that was never my intent in the first place. It replaced my Z3 BMW, and while both are really nice cars the Cayman S seems like a star ship, while the Z3 is more of a classic from the 50's. I have yet to find any major issues with the Cayman and hope that it runs as good 10 years from now as it does today. The Navigation system is difficult to figure out the first few times of using it so wish they would team up with Garmin and keep thing simple but it works well once you get it set up. ",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),It just felt right," Ah, what a car. I tested several others - STi, 'Vette, 335i, 370Z. This is the only one that felt just right. Came from a '06 Miata so I didn't want a large car. This had the power, sound, handling, looks...everything. It's just right for me. Sometimes I just wish it had a backseat so I could share the experience w/ more than 1 other person at a time. I have the Carmon Red and it's a beauty but I'm actually surprised at the smiles I get. She definitely holds her own at track days as well of course. Yes, the cup holders seem rather delicate and not well placed - that's why I don't use them. The xenon headlights are very good and I'm happy w/ the stereo. Certified warranty is excellent too!",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Can't Bring Myself to Replace It," The vehicle has been perfect for my needs; I commute daily and also enjoy performance driving at the track.  I kept the vehicle in stock form and it has not given me any grief or issues.  A coolant leak that occurred was handled promptly by dealer under warranty, and that has been the only reliability issue for the past 68K miles.  This vehicle exceed my expectations in terms of reliability, versatility and fun factor.",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),I'm In Love With My Car," I now know what Queen was singing about all those years ago. Fun does not begin to describe the driving experience. Heavy traffic has prevented me from really opening her up yet, but the couple times I've been able to accelerate hard on to the highway I could not stop smiling from the sheer exhilaration. She sounds incredible, guys look at her with lust in their eyes and, like a previous reviewer, I catch myself looking back at her after I park her at night. I feel like I'm dating a supermodel (German, of course).",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),More fun than you can imagine," The balanced nature of this car stuns me every time I drive it.  The combination of chassis, steering, transmission and engine are the best I have ever experienced.  It is an easy car to drive around town, but one time on a twisty mountain road is all it takes to feel the superlative power and handling.  It is also the best-looking car I've ever owned.  The Cayman is surprisingly practical:  trunks front and rear mean errands, weekend getaways for two, or even two sets of golf clubs get the green light.  The car has been mechanically flawless for 2+ years, although it has two niggling rattles.",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Coupe de grace!," The Cayman is a superb package. While the car can be comfortably driven in the city, it is a delight on the back roads where traffic is not an issue. The high power-to-low weight ratio and the mid-engine layout make the car nimble and well-balanced with loads of torque. I have owned several coupes and this is the best one by far. It is a car that really responds to you as a driver. And of course the body styling is fantastic! ",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),30K Plus review," This car is one of the best handling cars I've ever had.  I used to race a fully track prepared EVO VIII and the Cayman S is as close as cars come to that.  Very exciting over 5200 RPM, plenty of torque and engine sound is aggressive, yet more refined than some kid with a coffee can import.  Better yet, it's a great daily driver with plenty of room for groceries, luggage and whatever else you could want (that was the tipping point for me between the Cayman and the 911).",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Obsession," My first Porsche, this speed yellow with black leather beauty is like having a Carrera or a Ferrari without the huge price tag.  I really like the basic sport feel, almost like a vintage car, with not too much electronic stuff, and not so much glossy plastic trim.  As a designer, this car really appeals to me from an aesthetic view. Compared to the Mercedes I was using for a daily driver, this is way more fun, and I love to make 90 degree turns going 45 mph. Now have about 18K miles. Sits in a nice large garage, like a sculpture. Driving a Porsche in Naples is about as good as it gets, even though we have one of the largest PCA memberships in the country. I highly recommend it. Good ego trip.",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Great Sports Car," Fun to drive and plenty of power. I'm 6'2"" and comfortable although the seat is all the way back. Still plenty of head room. Standard seats really hug you might be a little narrow for someone over 200 lbs. Tall passenger seat totally obscures the small window behind the door creating a blind spot. They can also hit and damage the headliner if not careful. Bose system has too much bass but a satisfactory adjustment can be made. The wheel size makes a huge difference in ride quality and the larger wheels will probably lead to more rattles with time. The used Caymans I drove with 17s felt sold and had little rattling. 18s were a little worse and 19s were much worse. I went with 18s for looks.",4
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Cayman S," This is my daily driver and haven't had a single issue with the car (I have over 30k miles). The car is absolutely beautiful and attracts a lot of attention from other drivers.  The storage capacity in the car is unbelievable, 2 trunks with over 15 cubic feet of storage capacity.  I haven't had a situation yet where i couldn't fit everything into my car.  I average about 20 MPG which isn't bad for Washington DC traffic.  It is an absolute joy to drive and it worth every penny.",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),"2007/8 Cayman after 10,000 miles"," I am 6' and 220 lbs. Nice head/leg/cargo room. Have 11,000 miles on the car driving locally, and to and from CA from Fl. Comfortable long distance driver.  Outstanding looks. Have been stopped several times by compliment givers. Handling is as though one were driving on rails. Acceleration is swift though not overpowering. Actual gas mileage is 23/27 so far. Have 18"" wheels. Bose system has too much bass for my taste, and I have to dial the db down to negative numbers to get balanced sound. This is my first Porsche and I love it. . I highly recommend this car for what it is....an exhilarating driving experience every time. J.D. Powers #1 rating influenced my decision to buy. I'm glad I did",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Fantastic," Beautiful car, fantastic performance.  This car is great on the street and on the track.  On the track, handling is precise and the brakes are awesome.  Enough power to stay with all but the turbo's.  Wide power band.  This engine loves 6200 rpm.  On the street, it attracts a lot of attention.  Lots of leg and head room.  Interior quality is superb.",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),My Face Hurts! , From smiling when I drive this thing.  It moves where I want it to move and does it quickly and without lag.   I love this car!,5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),The 2.7 (aka base) Cayman," Much has been written/said about the Cayman s; all justified.  The Cayman 2.7 has enjoyed fewer reviews, yet it remains a totally engaging Porsche.  It has the same platform, same build quality, same fun to drive, better fuel economy (mine gets 27-28 mpg mixed driving... And runs at 30+ at steady freeway speed!).  So, what is the downside?  surely not the 10k less Price!     Yes, it has 50 less hp, concomitantly less torque and 5 speeds instead of the lovely 6 speed.  But for daily driver duties, one cannot even use the 245 hp the Cayman 2.7 offers!   I've taken my 2.7 on a track day (thunderhill) and find that it handles and marks well most other makes and was a blast to drive.  ",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Fantastic Sports Car!!," I fell in love with this car at the 2006 LA Auto show and ordered it from the factory, spec'd just like I wanted it. Waited nearly 4 months for it to arrive, but well worth the wait. This car is special in every way. Plenty of power, handles better than anything I've driven (I own two other sports cars that are very highly rated), and looks great! I'm of average size and weight, and strapping into this thing feels like stepping into my favorite pair of jeans. (Might be a bit small for anyone taller than 6'2"".) Handling is it's strongest suit - feels like it will never break loose!",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Porsche Cayman," Have 1500 miles so far on this 2007 Cayman. Steering is tight, precise, responsive and consistently provides an ""on-rails"" cornering experience. The acceleration is quick, but not overpowering. The engine sound is great! The looks are superb, and the gas mileage is surprisingly good. I'm averaging around 26 mpg. Have yet to take it on an extended cross country, but anticipate that the mileage will increase with more miles on the engine. I use this car almost daily and it is always a thrill to drive. The seats are form fitting on my 6 foot 1 inch frame and as a consequence are warm to my back, but there is plenty of head and leg room. Cargo room is generous for a car in this class.",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Rock Solid, This car is better than I dreamed.  It is rock solid and feels like it was carved out of a single slab of granite.  It is extemely well balanced and the back end just digs in at virtually any speed.  It just wants to run fast and is a joy to drive.  It is more immpressive in the corners as I find myself seeking tight curving roads.  I get looks and compliments all the time.  Well worth the purchase.,5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),My Cayman S," Handling without peer; superb balance in the corners; unmatched braking; Porsche quality.  Car is funnest to drive of any I've had (inc. Vettes and Vipers) - pure driving experience.  Commands attention.  Xenon lights a must. Buy the S model, you'll thank yourself in the end.",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),A ride in the theme park," I bought a silver 2007 Cayman with Tiptronic in September 2007.  I believe it's one of the few Caymen with Tiptronics in CA.  Engine: Tiptronic still delivers excellent power / acceleration without the Cayman S engine. Best of all, it's idiot proof.  Inside: the cockpit design is unique. To quote my wife, it feels like getting into a 007 car. However, Tiptronic handle bar does not light up at night.  Ride experence:  a luxury sedan can get you from point A to point B quietly, without you ever noticing its presence.  A Cayman, on the other hand, will turn each driving trip into a Disneyland theme park ride - fun, exciting, but not scary.    ",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Porsche... there is no substitute.," This is a sportscar that has to be driven to be believed and for the normal driver the 2.7 has more than enough hp and torque to keep a permanent grin on your face.  As mine is a daily driver, in heavy traffic, I chose the Tiptronic and I'm not disappointed with its performance at all.  In manual mode it shifts extremely quickly and it screams thru the twisty turns, easily keeping pace with my buddy's Corvette... without ever touching the brakes.  The car is a real looker in meteor gray with the Boxster S wheels, chrome twin exhaust and I really like the preferred package extra touches.  Be prepared to talk ""Porsches"" to complete strangers drooling over your car as most have never seen one.  ",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),The REAL Ultimate Driving Machine," This is my first Porsche after a myriad of other sports cars, Z4, RX-8, several Miatas, SLK, etc.  The Cayman S is without question superior to all of the foregoing.  Its sound is intoxicating as is its performance and handling, and brakes.  It works well as a daily driver, too.  It has very satisfactory storage space and holds my golf clubs in the rear trunk with a little juggling.  It is just a great car that Porsche is holding back on to keep the iconic 911 on top.",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Glued to the Road Always," Bought 6 speed manual Cayman S as pleasure driver, not everyday commuter.  Have had for 2 months, have about 3000 miles on it, highlight was a drive up and back on back roads including Highway 1 LA to Monterey for MotoGP a few weeks ago. Handling, shifting, road feel superb, I spent a lot of time going through the twisties and laughing out loud with pleasure.  Has plenty of power on the street to get you tickets even if it does not have 911 hp.  And it is not even broken in yet.  Car gets a lot of looks, and I love the look of it (and I hate the Boxster.) Yes the car is noisy and a very firm ride (19 inch wheels), stereo is so so but listening to the engine is the real musical experience!",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),"Just like old times, just better"," I've had my '07 Cayman S for about a month now and all I can say is WOW! Of the Porsches I have owned and driven, this is by far and away the best handling and best looking. The husky exhaust note and power @ 4500 rpms and above is incredible. The Cayman S is 100% pure sports car. With a few tweaks to the 3.4 ltr. engine, suspension and exhaust coupled with the mid engine platform, the Cayman S's performance is as good if not better than the 997 for a lot less money. ",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),The REAL Ultimate Driving Machine," The Cayman S is simply the best sports car for the buck.  No, it's not the fastest, but straight-line speed is only a part of the equation.  This car handles like no  other I've owned, including a multitude of Benzes, BMWs, Miatas and an RX-8.  To add to its value, it is a useful sports car with decent storage and trunk space for its two passengers.  And it works as a daily driver with decent gas mileage and comfort.  This car is a truly wonderful machine that Porsche will probably regret that they built once 911 owners find out that buying down will give them a new high!",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Cayman out of Water, This car is so fun to drive.  I love the automatic transmission (can't drive a stick anymore for medical reasons).  I get a lot of looks in this car.,5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Cayman Review, Have had the 2.7L base Cayman for three months. Almost the performance of the S model for $10K less. Car puts smiles on my face everytime I drive it. Hugs the corners like its glued to the road. Excellent build quality and gorgeous sheet metal - lots of compliments. ,5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),I think I made a mistake...," I drooled over the Cayman for a month before finally buying the car.  I think it is a real stunner in sheet metal, prettiest car on the road.  I am starting to find the interior noise and the rough ride wearing on my nerves, especially if the pavement is rough. I came out of a 330ci that was a nice car and almost as peppy, but not as much fun to drive.  The dealer suggested I change out the tires to a non performance model but that is a bit costly so I guess I'll just deal with the road noise.  I can't imagine going on a long trip in the Cayman without plenty of Motrin.  Starting to remind me of my ex - beautiful to look at but hard to take after awhile.  Maybe I just miss my BMW.",4
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),My Cayman S," This is a true sports car, and sounds like it. The quality of the vehicle is superb. This car is for those that love to drive, and get there quickly and safely. The brakes are the best of any vehicle I have ever driven. The manual transmission is one of the best I have used. I simply love to drive this car.",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Fun car, This has been an absolutely fun car to drive.  It is driveable on a daily basis and just a kick to be in.  Bought with preferred package plus with tip and love every aspect of it.,5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Pure Porsche ," I just purchased my first Porsche and am very happy with its performance. I traded up from a BMW X5 and haven't looked back once. The handling is nothing short of telepathic and cabin comfort is ideal. I opted for the Tiptronic automatic transmission because of traffic and am pleased with its performance. The car has turned a good many heads since I purchased it. The cargo space is surprisingly generous for such a car, as I can fit a (small) bag of golf clubs in the rear hatch. ",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),My Cayman," I have owned Benz, Z3s, Z4s, Boxsters, RX7s, Talons, and I am ashamed to say 6 Corvettes. The Cayman is one of the most wonderful cars that I have owned.  With the rear spoiler up, people actually think I am driving a 911.  With the quality and look of the interior, I did not have to go with the 911.  The ride is smooth, the handling is superb, and the middle range power and acceleration (60-120) is out of this world!  I purchased this one and will own it forever.  I retire in 3 years and am looking forward to driving cross country and seeing every sight that I have missed before I pass away. Love my Cayman!",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),"What a Car!  Vielen Dank, Porsche!"," it was time to move into modern times from my 1981 Corvette. I am more than thoroughly pleased with my Cayman!  The body design is, well, simply gorgeous. For 245HP, it performs nicely even at >6,000 ft. elevation. The fit and finish are incredible. At a lanky 6' 2"", it is more than accommodating. It has lots of luggage space.  It will be terrific for our road-trip ventures. My black-on-black certainly turns heads (yes, a little ""vanity"" there...). It's just a perfect fit.  It's a fantastic car for the price, period.",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),My Cayman Rules," I have driven over 40 autos since the age of 16.  6 Corvettes, 3 BMWs, 3 Mazdas, 3 Mercedes, Talons (Junk), Buicks, 442s, and countless others, but this is the best thing since sliced manifolds.  The Cayman is far, above, and beyond any other autos out there.  Although it has more horsepower than my Boxster, and less torque, it is the quickest thing I have driven since my 427 vette fitted with tripower (69).  The mid range  power is fun, and truly sends me and passengers into the seats.",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),My First Porsche," I have had many Corvettes, all of which were maintenance nightmares. I moved on to the 2004 350Z, which never cost me a dime and delivered lots of performance and pleasure.  I wanted to move up to Porsche and liked the mid-engine design.  I love the sound this car gives to you with each gear change.  It handles better than my Z and is just a touch faster. ",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Just Picked One Up...," I just got a new 2007 Cayman S model. I am very happy with it overall. It is great looking, well built, and has a nice interior. It's also very quick. It drives like a sports car, meaning a firm, but not harsh ride. I went with the 19"" wheels. Some options should be standard, but that's Porsche. Its gas mileage stinks, but that's to be expected. This car has great German engineering all around, even in the smallest details.",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Best Car I've Ever Owned," This is by far the best handling, fun to drive car I've ever owned.  The styling is classic.  The precision steering and great brakes make it feel safe at all times.",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Weekend Delight," I purchased the Cayman to replace our '05 SLK350 and drive it primarily on weekends.  I test drove most of the competition as well as the Cayman S and 911 Cabriolet.  For me, the Cayman has the perfect blend of style, performance, efficiency and value.  Sure, there are times when I think I could use the extra hp but those times have been seldom.  Although some will tell you that they prefer the more ""classic"" line of the 911, I think the Cayman is in a style class by itself.  Just hand the key to any valet if you need confirmation.  If you want a livable, fun to drive two seater, I don't think there is any car on the market that can match the new Cayman.",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Class Act," Driving the Cayman s brilliant. Even sitting in it you feel 50% better for being alive.  Everything is to hand switchgear wise, plenty of seat adjustment, good visibility.  The responsiveness of the engine when you are already cruising at 80 reminds you that its really going at half speed. It is so solid on the road that even with side winds doing high speeds. Long bends where previous cars would go light at speed are no problem at all.  The only drawback so far are the chips from small stones on the bonnet - well you can't have everything. I bought the plastic trays for the front and rear storage as recommended by the local Porsche Club chairman.  Roll on the Panamera : )",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),True Driver's Car," This is the first Porsche that I have fit into, barring the sunroofless GT3. I have been in a sports car-less funk since I sold my '95 Miata R-package. The Cayman is the perfect replacement. It is a comfortable daily commuter with absolutely brilliant handling and perfect suspension tuning. The 2.7 liter six engine is an absolute gem, very flexible and aurally pleasing. It is also very practical with both trunks and cabin storage.",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),I'm Sure Glad I Didn't Get the BMW., I had ordered a '07 BMW 3-Series Coupe and I thank God every day I get into this car that I purchased a Cayman instead of waiting for the BMW.  This car fits like a glove and drives like a dream.  I find myself feeling sorry for all those people driving anything other than a Porsche. ,5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Excellent Car, This is my first Porsche and I absolutely love it!  I drove a Jaguar before this one and I definitely prefer the Porsche Cayman.  It captures attention every time I'm on the road.,5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),"Who Needs the ""S""?"," I traded in my 2004 Nissan 350Z and what a difference.  The Cayman is refined, has smooth power, incredible brakes, and handling that is go-cart like.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and this design is a BEAUTY!  It has class, balance, and style.  My Cayman has no options except 18"" Cayman S wheels which I highly recommend and the Arctic Silver Metallic paint.  You don't need anything else and this gets you a sub $50,000 race car for the road.",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Fantastic Car!," In everyday driving the Cayman is civilized, comfortable, and easy to drive.  When the traffic thins out and the road opens up, it takes on a whole different personality, gobbling up twists and turns with the engine roaring like a savage beast.  After a month I still haven't really used the Bose sound system.  The sound of the engine is even better music to my ears.  Now that the break-in period is over, I can savor the sounds of the upper rpm range... sweeeet!",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Better Than My 2003 BMW M3," This is easily the best overall perfoming car that I have owned. It feels quicker than my BMW M3, except from 70 mph up. Its handling outshines all (for the money) except the Lotus Elise, but the build quality and sound from behind you more than make up for any performance difference. The ride quality allows for daily driving without punishment. Additionally, the manual transmission is wonderfully weighted and precise.",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),"Great Car, but Overpriced"," I wanted to test drive the new entry level Porsche. The Boxster S is the same price so it is a better deal.  I liked the car, but it needs 50 more horses to really be worth the $55,000 price tag.  The handling and shifter are the best.  Compared to BMWs and the Corvette, which both cost same amount, this Cayman is way more fun to drive and it has better handling.  But 245HP is way to weak for a $55,000 car.  Porsche also needs to stop jacking people on the options which can easily add $10,000 - $20,00 more to the car's price.  Skip the Cayman and get the Cayman S or 911.  But that engine sounds sweet!",5
2007 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 5M),Phenomenal Car," Without a doubt the Cayman is the best car I have owned, my previous car was an Audi A6 2.7T.

2016 Porsche Cayman Coupe GTS 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),An Excellent Sports Car!," This car is a blast to drive! It looks gorgeous at any angle with beautiful lines and dimensions. The 3.4L engine is powerful and sounds amazing (I would definitely recommend the Sport Exhaust!) all the way to its redline! Handling is second to none with so much grip and the feedback from the steering wheel is perfect. With a low curb weight and a stiff chassis, the Cayman does a wonderful job of carving through winding roads all day long. Braking is superb and constant. While not necessarily the import factor in buying a sports car, the gas mileage is pretty good in my opinion for what the car has to offer. I can get in the low 30's on the highway and average about 24 mpg combined (not far off from other 6 cylinder vehicles I have driven). The interior is well laid out  and has plenty of room for occupants (I'm 6'5"" and by no means uncomfortable) though egress in and out can take a little getting used to if you are tall, but this is true of most smaller sport cars. Materials are top notch and the level customization is pretty incredible (though it can get pricey quickly). I love this car and see myself driving it for a long time!",5
2016 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 6M),Great for what it is," Great handling, very responsive engine, more room than the 911, very close quarters inside but I knew that going in.  Some of the climate controls don't work as I'd like; always turning on when the car is started even if it was off when the car was stopped, no way to just use the fan without it trying to match the temperature settings.  Nav is less intuitive to use than a Garmin.  I'd prefer less technology overall, less complexity.  A design issue is that they use gravel on the roads here when there's ice and the brakes are susceptible to gravel getting stuck in them causing a scraping sound and possibly need an expensive fix by the dealer, so I find myself limiting my winter driving.  But it's really fun to drive.",4
2016 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 6M),2016 Cayman is a real pleaser!," I traded my 2006 Guards Red Cayman S for my new 2016 Agate Gray Cayman, and I am very glad that I did. Both cars were super fun to drive, each for slightly different reasons. Plenty of power, great handling, and superb brakes for having fun on the highways and back roads. The car is agile and accurate, moving perfectly in response to a tight steering ratio, and great road feel transmitted to me while underway.  The 2016 has a little more leg room inside for taller drivers. My fuel consumption is not as good as advertised, but that is because when I drive the car I usually am in Sport Mode and maximizing the ""fun"" that I bought the car for. If there is anything to complain about, it is that I sometimes get carried away with the amount of fun that I am having while running faster than the posted limits! I don't do lots of boring expressway driving, which would greatly improve the average fuel economy.   Aug. 2017: I have now owned this 2016 Cayman for over a year, and I continue to enjoy immensely the car on the road, in all types of weather and traffic conditions.",5

2016 Porsche Cayman Coupe S 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),"Unlike previous reviewer, I'm a real Porsche owner"," Sorry, but ""911 drives like a bloated Buick""?  ""Namby pamby automatic transmission""?  [non-permissible content removed]  I'm a 10 year member of the PCA and have never heard any real Porsche owners talk such stupidity.Now, regarding the Cayman....I own a 2014 Cayman S with 6 speed manual that was just in for its 3 year (24k miles) service.  What a low cost pleasure it has been.  Still on all four original 20"" Pirellis with 5/32+ tread left and brakes are like new (8/32+)......notwithstanding two half day auto cross events.  Tight as a drum and not a rattle to be found.  The Cayman is a better daily driver than my previous 911/997 S.  Which, BTW, handled spectacularly as well, but the 911 is 300+ lbs heavier, not as nimble and a rougher ride  around town.  I've averaged 21 mpg since new, with 30 mpg at 75+ on highway.  Golf clubs fit in the hatch, the ""frunk"" handles the luggage; I've been on several weekend roundtrips of 600-800+ miles with my wife.  Handling and steering  are truly exceptional - equal or better, IMO, than my buddy's Ferrari 430.  Straight line acceleration isn't head-snapping spectacular, but still very good and better than ""only"" 325 hp suggests; thanks to the 2,900 lb curb weight.  Short throw 6 speed makes rowing your own a true pleasure on this car (notwithstanding that the PDK is the best dual clutch transmission on the planet, for anybody that is uneducatedly concerned about being a namby-pamby)   Overall, the Cayman S is the most enjoyable sports car I've owned.  Recommend PASM and sport chrono packages.  Also, 18 way adaptive sport seats are great, but if you need to save $3,000, the manual ""Sport Seats Plus"" are more than adequate.",5
2016 Porsche Cayman Coupe GTS 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Best Car I'll Ever Own," Upon retiring, I didn't need a boat-of-a-car anymore, so I decided to downsize.  The Cayman's the perfect choice.  I considered a 911, but, though it's a two-seater, it feels and drives like a bloated Buick.  Although I come from a Lexus family (5 cars, 48 total ownership years), I'm not accustomed to the design and build quality that Cayman gives.  It is rock solid and is a pleasure to drive.  The gas mileage is much better than my last Lexus sports car, and its performance, as expected, blows it away.  I specially ordered a manual transmission and have no regrets--why would anyone want automatic transmission on a sports car?  It's not that easy to get in and out of, but that's the sacrifice you have to make to own a car that catches your eye every time you're near it.  A friend was torn between buying a Corvette or a Porsche, to which my response was ""Why would you consider buying the best hamburger McDonald's makes over a steak at a steak house?""  Corvettes are beautiful cars, but buying one over a Porsche?  No rational person could make that choice.  (The friend ended up cancelling his Corvette order and bought the Porsche.)I've had my Cayman for 30 months now, and I have no reason to change any of my earlier opinions.  It's worth every penny of what I paid.  Why would anyone buy anything else?",5

2011 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.9L 6cyl 6M),Can I see my engine please," I just had the car for 3 days and put 200 plus miles on it. It's a fun car to drive, the handling is superb. Mine comes with sport chrono and comfort package, paddle shift steering, sound system upgrade, natural leather(red), 19"" wheel, and most of other options (bi xenon, etc). I regret my choice of an optional 19"" wheel, it makes the car too stiff and feels heavier then the test drive car. Maybe it would be better combined with optional PASM which I didn't take. ",4

2014 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 6M),Remarkable car...," First, I am an engineer in the world of transportation, mostly left brained with appreciation of art and music, hyper critical of all things automotive and not prone to hyperbole. This all started with a 2007 Cayman. In 56000 miles the car never broke once, nothing. One headlight bulb burned out and the batteries in the wheel sensors went to sleep. No leaks, no oil consumption, original brakes, 1.5 sets of tires. The car kept running while driving through the full force of a hurricane in Texas. Tractor trailers pulling doubles, carrying giant windmill blades totally buried the car with tire wash several times, the car never noticed, it managed ""as bad as it gets"" with grace and control, flawless. My faith in Porsche is rock solid. The 2014 Cayman; driving back from Lake Tahoe, pull off into a Porsche dealer and sit in a 2016 Cayman, it has me at Hello. Can't afford new, but CPO solves the problem with an anthracite brown, base 2014, with tan interior and 9600 miles on the odometer. Dealer research (not CARFAX) shows 3 software updates, no service problems, wrote a check, car is mine. This car is unbelievable, not an engineering term. It spent 2 winters in New York State. The car is flawless. Handling, motor, PCM, comfort, climate control, lighting, PDK etc., flawless. I learned to fly years ago, this is better. History puts 7 BMW sedans in my driveway, so far this is better. The car knows what I expect from it, before I ask. Not a car word, but the experience is ""personal"", balanced, involving. It's more like you wear the car then drive the car. My hope is the 2014 can live up to the delivery of the 2007. Time will tell the story, but for now ""remarkable"" fits best.In the end I sold this remarkable car. The emotional burden every time I left the car parked somewhere and the thought of something happening to it was not worth it. I know of more than one person who has taken the same path. The car was resold in less than 12 hours. I wanted to purchase a Porsche SUV, but could not afford it.As a final comment, I believe Porsche will live to regret moving the Cayman to 4 cylinders.",5
2014 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 6M),Base PDK is the daily driver king," My 2016  base model Cayman has the PDK transmission. This is my daily drive, as such, economy & reliability were important considerations. I constantly  obtain 31/32 MPG at 80+ MPH. In spite of  consistent reviews that claim the base engine lacks power, I find the 275 HP adequate and the base Cayman a blast to drive on open roads. The base engine would most likely lack required power to be competitive in a high performance track race, especially when powering out of turns for maximum lap times, but since I'll never get it on a race track, shes plenty fast. The PDK  transmission maximizes the cars performance, it's split second shifts can't be matched by man. I got the standard 18"" wheels & passed on every other option other than navigation, comfort pkg & sport steering wheel. After adding transportation fees and a clear bra I wangled a deal of $56,000 plus tax&license. I've had the car 7 months & 5,000 miles with no issues or regrets.  If your thinking about a sports car, I would strongly recommend the base Cayman with PDK as a consideration. As of mid April 2017, I  have nearly 8,000 trouble free miles on my base Cayman. On my latest weekend trip it got a whooping 33.6 MPG at 80/85 MPH!! The only negative is the cost of maintenance, the 1st oil change ran nearly $350!!! I'm told the 2nd service will be nearly $750.00 AND the 4th or 40,000 service is an astronomical $1500!! These are little mentioned details not provided by Porsche dealers during the buying experience. I do love the car, so I'll pay  & hopefully keep it 10 years. Just a reminder, mine is a 2016 model with the 2.7 liter six cylinder. The new  2017 Porsche Cayman's are now designated 718 models and have new 4 cylinder turbo charged engines, a design that's yet to be proven.It's now April 2018, I have 11,000 miles on the odometer without a hitch. All the hype about the base model with 275 HP being slow, is strictly MFG spin to get  buyers into high end models for more profit with a chance to visit your local jail. My battery was marginal so the dealer installed a new one under warranty. The car is all I expected EXCEPT for the cost of maintenance. The 10,000 mile service did cost $350.00, & the 2 yr (or  20,000 mi) service cost me over a grand and now I understand the 40,000 mi service is nearly TWO GRAND!!! I also head from Porsche service reps that the 718 Turbo Cayman is even more!! So be prepared to take out a 2nd on your house  once a year.",5

The only negative about this car. But no regrets. I can't say how much I love this car. The feeling you get when you get behind the wheel and turn the key and hear that engine behind you is a like a natural high. And when you get it out on the road and hit the pedal in Sports Plus the rush is amazing. This car has all the power you need. Actually you can't really get to enjoy it because there is not many roads that you can really take advantage of what this car can deliver. This is my second Cayman. First was a 2007 Cayman Base. The difference in the 2014 is amazing. A total different car. ",5
2014 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 6M),Base 2014 Cayman," I purchased this car from Brumos and had the most positive experience ever buying a car. Delivery took about an hour. The quality of this car is outstanding, it handles like it is glued to the ground, and there is plenty of power to get you out of trouble immediately. Luggage space is impressive and long drives are comfortable. I got 29.2 mpg with the cruise control set to 80. I never thought I would be doing this I have become addicted to performance driving schools and events. Although this car is no dragster (275 hp vs 600+), it is unmatched by most cars in turns and is extremely well balanced. (thank you blue flag) If a driver can smoothly carry momentum they will be tough to hang with.After 9000 miles and over $30,000 in repairs and very long waits for parts (nothing seems to be stocked and takes a boat from Germany after being custom made - it is not unusual for the car to be in the shop for 3-5 months) I would say that after owning it for 2.5 years it has spent close to a year in the shop.

German design shares this idea with it's cousin, the VW. Comfort, handling and performance will get you to where you need to go in record time, if you so choose.

2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Great Car," Porsche service costs a fortune, but the service personnel are top notch.  This car is a blast to drive, Porsches are the only cars for me.",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Cayman S Overview," So far my Cayman S has averaged 25-28 mpg.  You must use premium fuel in it.  It has very firm seats.  You must be careful of moving the passenger seat all the way back.  It will activate airbag warning system. The dark tinted rear window makes it difficult to see out back.  The buttons on the key activate the trunk and engine lids too easily.  You must be very careful of potholes in the road, the rims are easily damaged due to their low profile.  They are expensive to replace or repair.  This car is really fun to drive.  It delivers exhilarating performance above 4,000 rpm,  It has a low ground clearance, so you must be aware of debris on roads and in driveways.  It is easy to strike the undercarriage. ",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),"""Performance car of the year!"""," The Cayman S has great performance and is truly fun to drive.  I have driven Maserati, Aston Martin, and Ferrari, but this is one of my favorites.  I have always been a Porsche fan.  It's easy to drive and has a great sleek design.  The great thing about the Cayman S is it looks much more expensive than the car is priced.  The only other car I have driven that comes close is the Maserati Quattroporte and the Aston Martin Vanquish.  I love my Cayman S.",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Almost the Perfect Sports Car," The Cayman has incredible handling due to its mid-engine design.  It is more fun to drive than cars that cost twice as much. It has excellent acceleration, though the car needs to be at least in the 3,000 rpm range for peak performance. ",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Cayman S," The Cayman S is an excellent car!  It is a real joy to drive and a real head turner.  With the mid engine design, this car handles the mountain roads like no other.",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),New Car Impressions," I discovered a new white, brown leather Cayman S in the garage a couple of weeks ago; a gift from my wife to liven up a long commute which it does nicely. It has Bose, heated seats, power seats, all the stuff in the performance package plus and I have put on 610 lawfully driven miles so far with no surprises. The manual says take it easy (keep it under 4,200rpm) for 2,000 miles. That means 1,260 not very exciting miles ahead. After that I can tell it is going to be a sweet ride. Its initial fuel consumption is sky high but should improve. I had the 3M clear bra film installed. The car is tight, supple, loud, sticky, fast and driving it might be the most fun you can have with your clothes on.",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Watch out 911," I have driven BMWs for years now, but wanted more pure sports car for the track.  This car was just plain awesome on the 2.5 mile Heartland Park road course.  Porsche has to be under rating the speed and horsepower numbers on this car for fear of losing 911 sales.  If Porsche wanted to tweak it some more, this car and engine could blow the 911 out of the water.  This is a great car, hands down.  It puts a smile on my face every time I drive.  It's friendly as an everyday driver too.",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),2007 Porsche Cayman S," What an outstanding car!  My last two cars were 'vettes. This car is superior in performance, handling, quality and more fun to drive.  I get compliments everywhere I go.  Definitely get the PASM and spend the extra money on the leather interior - you will be glad you did.  The quality and worksmanship of the full leather is unbelievable. Only get the chrono package if you are going to track the car.  I wish I had chosen the sport shifter, but the stock six-speed shifter is still the best I've driven.  The Carrera 19"" wheels painted in the exterior body color is awesome.",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),What a Car, The Porsche Cayman S is extremely fun to drive.  It definitely makes you feel young and energetic.,5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),First Porsche," This car brings the fun and excitement back to driving.  I have had numerous sports cars, the most recent being a 2005 Corvette.  The Caymen S doesn't have the brute power of the vette, but with the mid engine you feel like you are part of the road and in control.  My car has not had any problems to speek of, except for a faulty radio, which was promptly replaced.  ",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),There Really is no Substitute," I have to say I have always been a practicality guy when it comes to cars and depreciating items.  This car beats my reason into submission and gets me on an adrenaline program.  Its build quality is beyond what you would ever see in almost any other mark.  The ride is like a rollercoaster that will not leave the track and the look is more exotic than anything Porsche has made in recent history. As Ferris Bueller said ""If you have the money, I highly recommend it.""  The engine noise is a sweet tune and the grip is like nothing else.  The seats are better than most aftermarket models and the curves of the body almost make you blush. It looks great in every color they make, leaving you smiling. ",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Amazing...," The Porsche Cayman provides really amazing bang for the buck.  This car handles impeccably.  My only compliant is that the car could use a few more horsepower, but I guess they need to protect the Carerra.  It does zero to sixty in 5.1 seconds, which is still pretty darn quick.  It is a blast to drive.  The sound of the engine above 4,,000 rpm is exquisite.  I miss it when I'm not driving.  I would skip the Bose stereo system, but the sport shifter and PASM are recommended.  It looks great in silver, and much better in person than in photos.  I recommend it over the stock Carrera for all around fun, the C4 and turbo versions excepted.",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),I Love My Cayman!, Everything about this car is great. At delivery the radiator had a leak. I have had no problems since.  This is by far the best car I've ever driven.  I like it better than my Boxster!,5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Two Cars in One," I purchased my Cayman S 2 1/2 weeks ago and have driven 2,150 miles to date. What an awesome machine!  Putt around town, in traffic and keep the rpm below 4,000 rpm and you have a very docile, easy to drive pussy cat...put your foot into it and it becomes a TIGER above 4,500 rpm. I chose the car for it's styling, handling and engineering and it has far surpassed any expectations I had! To me this machine is a culmination of the very best of every Porsche ever made! Next time I'll pass on the Bose system, as I find the bass a bit too flabby for my taste. For those who want more power, try the driving school, as the race track is the ONLY place you might need more power.",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Possibly My Last Car ," Since 1992 I've owned the following cars: two twin turbo Toyota Supras, three Acura NSXs, a Honda S2000, and four BMW M3s.  I've driven all these cars on the Sebring race track and I was completely blown away by the Cayman S.  The handling, power (especially in low gears), the clutch/gearbox, and brakes are phenominal.   I was convinced that I was getting the new Z4 M Coupe, but I was lucky enough to have a dealership that had both cars to drive.  I drove them 30 minutes apart and the Cayman S was beyond better in every area (except cup holder).  I found the car with the options I wanted and had it home one week later.",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Fabulous Driver's Car, This is the best driver's Porsche south of a 911 RS. The mid-engined layout offers balance and feedback to the driver which is matched only by a Lotus Exige (the difference being that you can get in and out of the Cayman without being a contortionist). It looks much better in the metal than in photographs and the looks grow on you too. Buy it in red or black - rather spend your money on the PASM active suspension option than pay for metallic paint. If you see someone driving a 911 you're never sure if they have bought it for the image - you can be sure the Cayman owner bought it for sheer thrill of driving. ,5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Best of the Best," This is my third Porsche after a Boxster and a 911. This is the best performer and most stylish Porsche ever built. It is fun and powerful. If you are not a porfessional driver with access to a speedway, this is the best Porsche you can get and enjoy every single drive. ",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Cayman S," In one word ""BALANCE.""  The Cayman is not the fastest Porsche out there, but it is the most balanced Porsche out there. Its handling combined with it's 295HP motor makes it the best driving Porsche to date. Its fit and finish is right up there with the 997s, and it is likely better looking than the 997. I added the Short Shift Kit from Porsche after delivery made and that made it even sweeter to drive.  I can say there isn't a better sports car out there for under $120,000 that can touch it.",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Awesome Car, My 2006 Porsche Cayman has been an incredible all around sports car - not just for performance but for its ease of use around the city.,5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Cayman is Superb," The Cayman's gorgeous exterior and interior have drawn more appreciative comments than any car I've owned.  The optional leather interior is worth the (high) price, as are the more attractive 19"" wheels and the sport seats and steering wheel.  The chrono looks good, but like the Sport package is worthwhile only if you plan for track use.  Its power is especially good at high RPM, ok at low RPM too but not like my Z06 Corvette.  The engine sound is exhilarating but can get tiring on the highway.  The optional stereo is excellent. ",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),No Substitue," Fellow owners have already expressed my thoughts.  I do not have anything more to add other than this is an incredible handling car for the money.  The 10-11 pm side profile is absolutely gorgeous!  The 12 noon (head on) profile is stunning!  My Boxster S' 18"" wheels look great against basalt black.",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Awesome ride!," After selling my BMW 330 convertible, I went into the Porsche dealership to test drive a Boxster S and ended up purchasing the Cayman S and I have no regrets.  There is no comparison between the Boxster S and Cayman S....the Cayman blows it away,  It has much better performance and handling and a sleeker style.  The styling is so incredible that everywhere I go I get compliments on the car.  ",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Fantastic!," I am the PCA Cayman Register chairman and as such have extensive experience with this car, having owned my personal one since Jan of 2006.  The car is an excellent combination of power, agility and engineering.  Pictures don't do it justice, you really need to drive this car to appreciate it.  I have done several track days with this car and it far and away exceeds my expectations every time.  Porsche - There is no substitute!",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Smile from ear to ear," The Porsche Cayman is a PURE JOY to drive.  It has a completely different feel that the Boxster S (the car I traded in) and in my opinion more fun than a 911 and more forgiving to drive.  The Bose stereo, xenon, heated seats, 19"" etc are musts - I had to settle for no nav as this was an unplanned purchase.  I was stuck in traffic by the dealership and they let me test drive the car / fall in love / have to have it / drive it home scenario.",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Smooth," After three weeks and 1,250 miles, I can honestly say this is the finest car I've ever driven. It has fabulous looks and handling and it is very comfortable with lots of room for a 2 seater. The brakes are wonderful, shifter like butter, and the engine sounds are awesome. I don't mind a long drive in this car, and everyone loves it wherever you go. The car has no bad habits.",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),better than 911!," The Cayman is one great coupe! I was going to order a MZ4 Coupe, but after seeing it at the auto show, no way. The Cayman S is way better looking and if you can afford one this is the best sports coupe for the buck!  This is my second Porsche, it is far superior to the base 911.",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Simply the Best," You drive it once and you can't live without it. The Cayman is built to last and drive! If you are a serious sports car fan, this is your dream car.",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),A True Dream of a Car," I've had my Cayman for two weeks and have put 600 miles on it.  The car is a dream all the way around - loaded with PASM, Navigation, Bose stereo, heated seats, xeon, 19"", sport chrono pack +, etc.  Get the Nav and the CD can play MP3s, although just in a single drive.  The Bose upgrade is worth every penny.  It sounds better than my Bose system in the house.  It's quick and sticks to the ground so well.  Plus it is a true head turner!!  The cup holders require fully covered lids and ""small"" sizes, unless you want to spill on your beautiful leather seats.  I wish the steering wheel were just a bit smaller (probably an option).  But all in all, I'd buy this car all over again.  Oh what fun.  And that engine sound - WOW!",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),More Fun than any other Car Owned," I recently purchased a Cayman S after reading many reviews.  I considered a 911 but test drove this car and was sold instantly. Just last night another driver pulled up besides to give me a thumbs up. Its so much fun to drive that I have to wipe the smile on my face after each drive.  I have driven it about 2,000 miles in all conditions. I just returned from a weekend road trip and it performed flawlessly.  Its handling and control were awesome at all speeds!  It had enough room for luggage and packages purchased with room to spare.",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),A Love Affair," A car that is the essential sports coupe, its more nimble than a ballet dancer and hotter than a super model. This car is balanced to perfection. On short rides in traffic you feel like a jockey on a race horse surrounded by mules, on long rides where you can really open the car up. Turn off the radio and enjoy the music of the 295hp engine singing to you... It says go! Go Faster! Take the long way home!!!",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),My First Porche," I picked up my first porche (Cayman S) on March 31. Lets see, I have put 1,000 miles on it in a couple of days.  The Cayman is fast and handles well. I bought it with Tiptronic. It is mainly used in a manual mode and it goes!  I hope to take it on a long drive i.e., through the mountains real soon. This is a fun car to drive!",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),"Wow, what a ride!"," Until now, I've been a BMW guy.  Now, I think I am a permanent Porsche convert.  This car is like a second skin and performs like a dream.  I am 6'1"", 220 and the seats are so well designed that you just settle in and enjoy.  The exterior design is the best I have seen and the throwback style is very distinctive.  The handling on small country roads, with tight turns is superb and on the highway the car is a beast!  I will enjoy this car for many years.  I understand now why so many 911 fans like the Cayman S more.  It is pure fun!  Now, if only I can get the tires to last beyond 5,000 miles...",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Surprisingly Quiet and Smooth Ride, I was very surprised to find that this car is very quiet (for a sports car). The ride with PASM is also very smooth.  The whole ownership experience has been pleasant and the car has so far been very reliable with no service incidents.,5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Only Minor Complaints," Buy this car.  It's awesome.  It's the only car that I have purchased in my life with NO regrets.  I would buy it again today without hesitation, but these need to be fixed for 2007 / 2008:  Interior cabin noise is loud.  When driving on the weekends that's great (it's a sports car afterall), but Wednesday afternoon with a client on the phone ain't so cool!  Callers often ask if I'm in a convertable.  No audible horn or noise when locking and unlocking the vechicle from the exterior with the fob.  You have to watch for two blicks of the lights when locking which can be difficult to see in the sun.  Rear hatchback button on fob is TOO big.  I accidently open the rear hatch a lot!",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),911 Detour," If you are out shopping for a 911 stop  by the Cayman department at your local porsche dealer first and save a lot of money. There is so many good things about this car. Terrific handling, to die for cockpit, intoxicating sound and performance, gorgeous looks. My first drive was a 650 mile drive through the mountain west and was as much fun as humans should be allowed to have.  This car, dollar for dollar is just about the best thing going.  I would love to have a 911 some day, but it may be a while because I love this Cayman.",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Affordable 911," If you are trying to muster the financial gumption to buy a 911, stop in the Cayman department of your local Porsche dealer and examine the Cayman. For most of you, this is all the performance you need.  I am not sure I can drive it to its full capabilities.  Fun, good looking, a dream to drive and a lot less than a 911. Amazingly good ride for a short wheel base. Very cool cockpit and an intoxicating engine sound.  Great value dollar for dollar.",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Great Car," I just picked up my Cayman as a weekend car.  So far it hasn't disappointed.  Had a minor computer error relating to the passenger airbag, but it cleared up by wiggling the seat around.  I chose a pretty plain package- wanted it for performance vs. bells and whistles.  The car definitely will get looks- even had someone snap a picture from their phone at a stoplight.   I am 6'1"" and legroom is a little tight if driving for much more than 1 hour.  This thing is a rocket- Drive it like you stole it!",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),"Great, Fun to Drive Car"," I managed to buy one of the two Caymans that the factory shipped to Qatar at the beginning of the year (Artic silver, full options ""sports"" version). It proves to be the perfect car for daily commuting through town, touring along the Cornice and of course, the somewhat higher speed runs on the highways through the country. I am looking forward to take it out on the race track!",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Exceeded Any Expectations," My Porsche Cayman S is extremely fast, yet gives you extreme control. There is no waiting for the power to come. At 4,000 rpm and onward, it's just an animal.  Porsche provides any exterior and interior color combinations one would possibly want. This is a good thing and a bad thing. It may be too hard to commit to just one. The view of the rear end is just captivating, the car shows different lines at every angle. There'll always be someone calling it ""Boxster Coupe."" Don't let that get to you, if you're going to get one, because it is and it isn't. It's so much tighter and sportier than the Boxster, let alone the practicality aspect.",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Cayman S," As pretty as it is, the Porsche Cayman S drives and corners better. I have absolutly no complaints other than a removable engine cover would have been nice. I believe it will live up to all of the write ups I have been reading about it for the last three years.  Where do I go from here?",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),It's a Sweet Ride," I've had my Porsche Cayman for three weeks now.  It's physically a very beautiful car that was designed by engineers.  I think the most outstanding aspect is that it is so well balanced.  Having the sweet sounding engine mounted aft of your head provides music to the ears (it is not overbearing at all).  I chose a lighter paint job (silver) so one can appreciate the beautiful lines.  I saw a medium seal grey metallic type paint at the dealer that I thought looked even better than mine.  I'd venture that the most common color chosen is silver.  The car turns heads, but that isn't why I got it (I'd actually prefer an invisible car).  I got it because it appeared to be the best sports car for less than $100,000.",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Rock Solid," My 2006 Porsche Cayman S' body structure feels like it is carved from a rock, but at the same time the car feels light on its feet.  It has an absolutely gorgeous curvacious body and nice sounds coming from the rear. Every girls love it! ",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Love at first drive...," First let me start by saying I built my Cayman on-line months before it was available. I almost didn't get it because when I called the dealer they said that all there cars were spoken for. Anyway I went into the dealer on the first day and they actually had a car the way I wanted, without all the extra bells and whistles. This car has muscle, it's been 20 years since my last Porsche and this car sets the standard. It handles great, its mileage is decent, and the comfort is good. The Cayman gets a lot of looks.  I've gotten many of nods of approval, and best of all I feel great. I finally know what it's like to be in the garage at night, washing the windows and dusting it off. ",5
2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Best porshe yet!," This is by far the best car Porshe has made. The performance and handling is utterly amazing. I own a porshe 911, and personally i believe the cayman looks and handles much better, for a much better price.  However this car is not as fast as   my Ferrari 350 modena.",5
